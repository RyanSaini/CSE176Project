# CSE176Project

This is for UC Merced Class CSE 176 Project 1.

The objective of this project is to do binary classification on two handwritten digits from the MNISTmini dataset. This project uses logistic regression and random
forests models in order to classify the two digits. Logistic regression models and random forests classifiers are made using the scikit-learn implementation.
